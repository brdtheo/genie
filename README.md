# Genie

Discontinued Genius clone created with React/Redux

> Genius has legal agreements with music publishers and considers the lyrics on their website to be a legal property of Genius, and won’t allow you to re-use their lyrics without explicit licensing. They even sued Google on grounds of stolen lyrics, asking for $50 million in damages, but to no avail. So it shouldn’t come as a surprise if they don’t provide lyrics in calls to the API.
